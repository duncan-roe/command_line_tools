Welcome to my command-line tools!

This directory contains files which modify the action of some of the tools.

You can dot any of the .sh files from Bash or any other Bourne shell directly,
and you might like to place some of them in /etc/profile.d

Alphabetically ordered list:-
 command_line_tools.sh     : Puts command_line_tools/bin in your PATH.
                             Recommended to go in /etc/profile.d
                             Safe to dot multiple times
                             (will only append command_line_tools/bin once).
 sfl_glob_patterns.sh      : Fairly comprehensive list of file suffices for
                             sfl and friends to search. Corresponds to what sfl
                             used to search before the introduction of
                             SFL_GLOB_PATTERNS to the environment.
                             Recommend to put one of the sfl_glob_patterns
                             files into /etc/profile.d
 sfl_glob_patterns_long.sh : sfl_glob_patterns.sh with some additional suffices,
                             (in fact the list I use).
                             Recommend to put one of the sfl_glob_patterns
                             files into /etc/profile.d
