Welcome to my command-line tools!

The majority of these are scripts or symbolic links to scripts.
3 are compiled programs: sources for all of them are here.

There are no releases of command-line tools.
You are recommended to clone it instead, and use "git pull" to get updates.

Most commands are in the bin directory below.
You could add them to your ~/bin or to /usr/local/bin,
but it's recommended to put command_line_tools/bin in your PATH
and only put local variants in ~/bin or /usr/local/bin. (You will have at least
3 local variants: the compiled versions of findit, disowntty and strerror).
(once strerror is in place, please also ln -s strerror strsignal).

Some commands come straight from dot_bashrc (which is a copy of my .bashrc). In
order of appearance, these are:-
 :  : cd to a sibling directory. Tab completion not available :(
 /  : cd to an immediate subdirectory (much as cd would do)
 pd : is an extended pushd. pd <some dir> does a pushd to that dir,
      but does not echo the new directory stack;
      pd with no arg works similarly.
      pd <some number> does pushd +<some number>,
      Likely fails with directories named "1", "2" &c.
 pdd: (pd down) is like pd but the new directory is inserted below the current
      entry in the stack rather than above. If (like me) you like to keep the
      directory stack in order then you can use pdd to a subdir to do that.
 GS / GD / GL / GLP : aliases for git {status,display,log,log pretty}
 .. : cd to parent directory
 s  : unwinds one level of shell invocation, i.e. it exits.
      In other words, it reStarts the process that invoked this shell.
      .bashrc does not define s when run in the bottom shell (SHLVL=1),
      in this case bin/s is obeyed instead.
 rdy: alternative to "s" which just tells you what shell level you're at,
      rather than terminating the shell if it's above 1.
 ]  : displays directory stack 1 entry/line numbered
 ]] : displays subset of directory stack with entries containing $1
 XRB: Gives a panning 640x480 display (for running old games).
      You will likely need to customise it to match your screen resolution
      (mine is 2560x1440) and video output if other than DVI-0.
 XRS: Reverts to full screen from XRB
 pc1: ping -c1
  c : 1-letter alias for cat
