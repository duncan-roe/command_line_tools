Welcome to my command-line tools!

The majority of these are scripts or symbolic links to scripts.
3 are compiled programs: sources for findit and strerror are here,
and the source for q is in a sibling repository.

These commands are in the bin directory below. You can add them to your ~/bin or
make bin your ~/bin if you don't already have one. ~/bin should then show up in
your PATH; fix your ~/.bashrc if it doesn't. Alternatively, you could add the
bin commands to some other directory already in your PATH such as
/usr/local/bin.

Some commands come straight from dot_bashrc (which is a copy of my .bashrc). In
order of appearance, these are:-
 :  : cd to a sibling directory. Tab completion not available :(
 /  : cd to an immediate subdirectory (much as cd would do)
 pd : is an extended pushd. pd <some dir> does a pushd to that dir,
      but does not echo the new directory stack;
      pd with no arg works similarly.
      pd <some number> does pushd +<some number>,
      Likely fails with directories named "1", "2" &c.
pdd: (pd down) is like pd but the new directory is inserted below the current
     entry in the stack rather than above. If (like me) you like to keep the
     directory stack in order then you can use pdd to a subdirto do that.
 .. : cd to parent directory
 s  : unwinds one level of shell invocation, i.e. it exits.
      In other words, it reStarts the process that invoked this shell.
      .bashrc does not define s when run in the bottom shell (SHLVL=1),
      in this case bin/s is obeyed instead.
rdy: alternative to "s" which just tells you what shell level you're at,
     rather than terminating the shell if it's above 1.
CD : defeats bash sourcepath option (you see where you really are)
]  : disaplays directory stack 1 entry/line numbered
]] : displays subset of directory stack with entries containing $1
XRB: Gives a panning 640x480 display (for running old games).
     You will likely need to customise it to match your screen resolution
     (mine is 2560x1440) and video output if other than DVI-0.
XRS: Reverts to full screen from XRB
