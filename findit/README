findit is a utility to verify whether a shared object can satisfy a particular
reference

You use it by:
  findit [libraries] [shared object] [entry name]
 where
  <libraries> is as you would specify to gcc, e.g. "-lm" for the math library;
   absolute path names also work as long as they contain ".so".
  <shared object> is the path name of the target, or the bare file name if the
   file is in one of the standard places or somewhere in LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
  <entry name> is as per program source, e.g. "printf".

Examples of Use (program output preceded by ">"):

findit /lib/libc.so.6 printf
> Found printf in /lib/libc.so.6 at 0xb77729a0
findit libldap.so ldap_simple_bind_s
> Found ldap_simple_bind_s in libldap.so at 0xb76de080

Some shared libraries require other shared libraries to be loaded first. That is
what the <libraries> parameter(s) are for. If you need <libraries> but don't
give them, you will usually get appropriate error messages.

TO BUILD: type "make".
 If you run 32 and 64 bit simultaneously, you need to build a version of findit
for each.
