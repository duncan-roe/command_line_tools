Welcome to my command-line tools!

Most of them are in this directory. There are 3 kinds of commands here: symbolic
links, shell scripts and compiled programs. Symbolic links are differentiated in
the list below by an "@" sign; scripts that need "expect" installed show with
"+"; everything else gets a ":".

You can get expect by following the links from http://expect.nis.gov/

To get a list of unique commands, you can "grep -v @ README".

Alphabetic list of commands:-
 afl    @ Like sfl but matches anywhere rather than only as a token.
 aflc   @ Like sflc but matches anywhere rather than only as a token.
 afll   @ Like sfll but matches anywhere rather than only as a token.
 afllc  @ Like sfllc but matches anywhere rather than only as a token.
 b2u    : Convert a series of numeric bytes to Unicode. One can look these up at
          https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Unicode
 bak    @ Like bu but for .bak files.
 bu     : Renames <file> to <file>.bu.
 chkhee : Tries to report only errors in the output from "make". By default
          expects the output from make to be in a file called "hee" after
            make 2>&1 | tee hee
          but it accepts a filename argument to replace "hee".
          To suppress the check for the word "no",
            export CHKHEE_NO_OK=yes
          before running chkhee.
 cmbak  @ Like cmbu but for .bak files.
 cmbu   : Compares <file>.bu with <file> (oldest file first).
          Accepts diff options but you have to put them at the end of the line.
 cmnew  : Like cmbu except it compares <file> with <file>.new (oldest first).
 cmold  @ Like cmbu but for .old files
 cmorig @ Like cmbu but for .orig files
 cmoriginal@ Like cmbu but for .original files
 cmreal @ Like cmbu but for .real files
 cmsave @ Like cmbu but for .save files
 cm_orig@ Like cmbu but for _orig files
 cm~    @ Like cmbu but for ~ files
 colours: Tk script to choose a colour you can specify numerically.
          (Actually an example from the book).
 confdiff: Compares Linux .config files by discarding comments & blanks then
           sorting both files before diffing them. This command compares some
           RCS revision (default latest) with the current file (by default) or
           some other revision, so if you use another revision control system
           then you will need to adjust it a bit.
 darkstar.sh+ I left this in more as an example than a useful command per se.
              Given that you are working on a system called dimstar and you want
              your display to show the output from an xterm running on a system
              called darkstar, this script will set up authorisation for your
              user on darkstar and start an xterm there.
 diffdir : Compares 2 directory trees that are under revision control,
           skipping comparisons of revision control metadata files.
           Currently implemented for RCS, CVS & git.
 dimstar.sh+ Is analogous to darkstar.sh but now you are logged in to some
             system (e.g. laptop, VM, router &c.) with a small or no X display
             and you want to work in an xterm displaying on your home system
             dimstar. "dimstar" is only a place-holder: you can symlink
             dimstar.sh to <your_system>.sh and the symlink will target
             your_system.
             Once you have one xterm, you can start more of them from it:
             root xterms also, as long as ~root symlinks ~/.Xauthority.
 dxt    @ like xt but sets different background
          (designed for when using a remote X server)
 findit : verifies whether a shared object can satisfy a particular reference.
          Build and install from ../findit/
 fl     @ Like sfl but search CWD only.
 flc    @ Like fl but case-independent.
 ggdb   + drives gdb with arbitrary gdb commands on the command line.
          See README_ggdb.
 ggo    + deprecated and no longer maintained predecessor to ggdb.
 glb    : Automatically adds "-E --line-buffered" to "grep".
          (glb == Grep Line Buffered). By using glb instead of grep in pipes,
          you see lines as soon as they are matched.
 k      : Pager. Extension of "less" to turn on line numbers unless input is a
          pipe (as determined by there being no non-option args).
          "k -N" turns off line numbers again (unlike "less -N")
          .bashrc exports LESS to leave the output from k on the screen.
          LESS also changes the ":" prompt to "More".
 kill0  @ Quick check of whether supplied PID is running:
          it is running unless kill0 returns "No such process".
 l      : given a fragment of a file name, find all files in the CWD and below
          with names containing that fragment, including dot files.
 lc     @ Like l but case independent.
 ll     @ Like l but follow directory symbolic links.
 llc    @ Like l but case independent and follow directory symbolic links.
 lxt    @ Like xt but with a large font (and less lines).
 manhunt: Searches all man pages in MANPATH for the string given as 1st
          argument. Options to grep may follow.
          Searches uncompressed and .gz files.
 megatstclean: Runs tstclean in all subdirectories with an RCS subdirectory.
 new    @ Like bu but for .new files.
 old    @ Like bu but for .old files.
 orig   @ Like bu but for .orig files.
 q      : The Q editor. Build and install from sibling q repository.
 rdme   : Attempts to display the top-level README in a tarball or zip file.
          Recognised suffices are tar, tar.gz, tgz, tar.bz2, tbz, tar.xz & txz
          (from line 4 of rdme). If you know any others, please tell me.
          rdme needs a recent GNU tar that decompresses automatically.
 real   @ Like bu but for .real files.
 rmbak  @ Like rmbu but for .bak files.
 rmbu   : Remove <file>.bu.
          (.bashrc stops .bu files from being offered by tab completion)
 rmnew  @ Like rmbu but for .new files.
 rmold  @ Like rmbu but for .old files.
 rmorig @ Like rmbu but for .orig files.
 rmoriginal@ Like rmbu but for .original files.
 rmreal @ Like rmbu but for .real files.
 rmsave @ Like rmbu but for .save files.
 rm_orig@ Like rmbu but for _orig files.
 rm~    @ Like rmbu but for ~ files.
          (.bashrc stops ~ files from being offered by tab completion)
 runindent.sh: Runs GNU indent over its arguments (.c & .h files) according to
               my quirky preferences. So treat it as a starting point.
               The -T lines declare enough special types for the Q editor but
               doubtless you'll want to add your own.
 s      : Echoes the shell level. See ../README: the command here (in bin) is
          only obeyed when .bashrc hasn't aliased "s" to "exit".
 save   @ Like bu but for .save files.
 sfl    : Search files in the CWD and directory tree below for a token (variable
          name, word etc.). Avoids wasting time searching binary files by only
          searching specified files (e.g.with extensions .c & .h) - you can add
          & remove files & extensions to suit your needs.
          sfl tries hard not to buffer output so for instance if you want to
          find all occurrences of the symbol SB600 in the Linux source then from
          the top-level directory you can enter:
             sfl SB600 2>&1|k
          and you will see matching lines as they are found, despite the "|k".
 sflc   @ Like sfl but case-independent.
 sfll   @ Like sfl but follow symbolic links to directories.
 sfllc  @ Like sfll but case-independent.
 showpath: List items in PATH, 1 per line. If given an argument instead lists
           MANPATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH or PKG_CONFIG_PATH;
           the argument is the first letter of the path name (case insensitive).
           You can extend this script for other paths in the obvious fashion.
 srt     : Sort file in-situ.
 strerror: Interprets its numeric arg as error text (c.f. perror(3)).
           Build and install from ../strerror/
 strsignal@ Like strerror but interpret numeric arg as signal description.
 tilde    @ Like bu but for ~ files (we can't have a command called ~)
 trecpy : Back-to-back-tar copy. Because it's tar it will copy tree names,
          so you need to cd to the parent of the source first.
          trecpy preserves all attributes and source access time (so it can
          make sense to trecpy a file rather than a dir).
          Symbolic links copy correctly (because of -U tar option).
          Accepts "-v" but no other tar options.
          Arg1: source object; Arg2 dir to contain copied object.
 tstclean: Diffs any files in the CWD that are known to RCS and are not up to
           date. Set env var TSTCLEAN_GREP_OPTIONS to change diff format.
 u2b    : Convert Unicode codepoints to bytes.
          u2b accepts 1 or more codepoints expressed as U+HHHH or plain HHHH
          and outputs the corresponding UTF-8 bytes in hex.
          This format is suitable for the foundation Q compose macro ^N^Wc
 ufl    @ Like fl but search siblings as well as the CWD.
 uflc   @ Like ufl but case independent.
 ufll   @ Like ufl but follow sibling symbolic links.
 ufllc  @ Like ufll but case independent.
 unbak  @ Like unbu but for .bak files.
 unbu   : Renames <file>.bu back to <file>.
 unnew  @ Like unbu but for .new files.
 unold  @ Like unbu but for .old files.
 unorig @ Like unbu but for .orig files.
 unoriginal@ Like unbu but for .original files.
 unreal @ Like unbu but for .real files. (My favourite command name :)
 unsave @ Like unbu but for .save files.
 un_orig@ Like unbu but for _orig files.
 un~    @ Like unbu but for ~ files.
 v      : ls with pagination. Output is in colour and files are classified
          (e.g. trailing "*" for executable). Entries are sorted by lines
          instead of by columns as is appropriate for pagination.
 vc     : Like v but ls output is monochrome.
 xfl    @ Like sfl but search all files
 xflc   @ Like sflc but search all files
 xfll   @ Like sfll but search all files
 xfllc  @ Like sfllc but search all files
 yfl    @ Like afl but search all files
 yflc   @ Like aflc but search all files
 yfll   @ Like afll but search all files
 yfllc  @ Like afllc but search all files
 xt     : Starts a new xterm with a login shell at SHLVL=1 (so "s" will work).
          xt sets the following nonstandard defaults:-
            -font: varies according to whether invoked as xt or lxt.
            -geometry: size varies according to whether invoked as xt or lxt.
                       command line can override - see below.
            -rw: Reverse wraparound is enabled.
            -ls: (login shell).
            -sb: Display a scrollbar.
            -sl: Scrollbar saves 2000 lines.
          Command Syntax:
            xt [-cd <dir>] [geometry | "-" [other xterm args...]]
          In other words, if you want to specify extra xterm args then you must
          provide a geometry or a single minus sign.
          Examples:
            xt -cd ~ - -bg palegreen1
            xt 80x24-0-0 -bg yellow
            xt - -bg orange
            xt -
            xt
 _orig  @ Like bu but for _orig files.

Notes:-
 runindent.sh: The Q macro ^N^W^G runs runindent.sh on the current file and
               pulls back stand-alone "/*" comments to line 1. If mode "fm +l"
               is asserted, the file will be saved with leading tabs
               (but no tabs elsewhere).
