strerror converts its (numeric) argument to the corresponding error message (as
perror(3) would print).

When invoked as strsignal, it prints a description of the corresponding signal
(as distinct from the signal name).

When invoked as kill0, it reports whether its argument is running (its argument
is a PID in this case).

Examples of Use (program output preceded by ">"):

strsignal 1
> strsignal returned Hangup
kill0 1
> kill0 returned with errno=1
strerror 1
> strerror returned Operation not permitted

TO BUILD: type "make".
